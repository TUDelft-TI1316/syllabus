# Algorithms and Data Structures

BSc Course TI1315/TI1315TW on Algorithms and Data Structures at TU Delft

## Voorkennis

The student has basic knowledge about object-oriented programming and 
can solve small programming tasks either in Java or Python.

## Vakinhoud

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental notions in computer science and
knowledge about standard data structures and algorithm is essential for programmers.
This course enables the student to

* Understand, explain, and implement standard data structures.
* Undertand, explain, and implement standard algorithms.
* Apply standard data structures and algorithms to solve programming tasks.
* Analyse and compare implementations with respect to their time and space complexity.
* Understand, explain, and apply standard programming techniques in the context of standard data structures.

## Onderwijsvorm

### Lectures (7w x 2c/w x 2h/c)

In the lectures, new data structures and algorithms are introduced by discussing 
  example applications, 
  their specifications,
  different implementations,
  and underlying basic theories.

### Instructions (7w x 2h/w)

In the weekly instructions, students implement and analyse new data structures and algorithms from the lectures
  and apply them to solve various programming excercises.
Students discuss their solutions in an interactive setting with other students and the instructor.

### Practicals (7w x 4h/w)

In the weekly lab assignments, students implement and analyse basic data structures and algorithms.
Each lab assignment comes with several public tests as well as hidden specification tests.
Students can rely on the public tests to improve their solution, 
while the specification tests indicate whether their solution is sufficient.

### Additional Lectures (2w x 2h/w) and Practicals (2w x 4h/w) for TW Students

In two additional lectures for TW students, we introduce the Java programming language.
In two additional lab assignments, student apply the newly required knowledge to solve basic Java programming assignments.
The additional lectures and labs compensate for an extra credit point for TW students.

## Wijze van toetsen

1. Lab assignments
2. Summative midterm exam
3. Summative final exam

In the computer-based exams, students need to implement and analyse data structures and algorithms.
The final grade is a combination of the results in the midterm exam (40%) and in the final exam (60%).
To pass the course, students need to pass the specification tests of all lab assignments and 
  have a final grade of 6 or higher.
Standard TU Delft rounding rules apply.
